This Morse encoder converts the Strings into International Morse Code, followed by the dash and dot beep sounds.
This Repository contains the files "dash.wav" and "dot.wav" which are to be included to your folder while executing this code.
Make sure to check you have "pygame", and "time" modules to run this code
